Architecture


HTML provides the foundation, establishing structure and content to the website. JavaScript provides the dynamic behavior, adding interactivity and responding to user input. And then the SPA wraps everything up, providing a single-page experience with no page reloads, thus ensuring a smooth user experience. MongoDB acts as the backend of the full stack project, providing a flexible, highly scalable, and fast database solution. Together these pieces create a powerful and efficient web application.

Functionality


JSON is different from JavaScript because it is just a data format, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON ties together the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a standardized data format that can be used between the two. I had to refactor code to help reduce the complexity, and make it easier to maintain and debug. Refactoring code can help reduce complexity and make it easier to maintain and debug. Reusing UI components can improve user experience, speed up development time, make code maintainable, and improve scalability. Benefits of using reusable UI components include faster development and debugging, reduced code duplication, and improved user experience.

Testing


Methods, endpoints, and security are all important components of a full stack application. They help to define how an application works and how it is accessed. They also help to protect the data and ensure that only authorized users can access it. Methods are used to define the specific steps for an operation, and give rules for how tasks are to be executed. Endpoints are the URLs that are used to access specific elements of an application. Security is used to protect data and ensure that only authorized users can access it, and include measures like authentication, encryption, and access control. Together, these elements provide the backbone for any full stack application.

Reflection


This course has given me a better understanding of the technologies and techniques used in development, as well as a thorough understanding of the development process as a whole. Up until this course, I had learned about front end and back end development, but this course really helped me tie everything together and gain a better understanding of how the individual elements of full stack development interact with each other. This course was not without its struggles. I spent a lot of time fixing bugs and scanning my project to understand what I was doing. I am excited to take the skills learned in this course and work on some side projects of my own to help solidify the knowledge gained.&nbsp;
